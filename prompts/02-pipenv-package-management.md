# Pipenv Package Management Request

## Request
use pipenv for package management

## Context
This was a follow-up request to modify the backend from using `requirements.txt` to using `pipenv` for Python package management.

## Implementation Changes Made
1. **Created Pipfile**: Replaced `requirements.txt` with `Pipfile` containing:
   - Production packages in `[packages]` section
   - Development packages (pytest, pytest-asyncio) in `[dev-packages]` section
   - Python version requirement: 3.11

2. **Updated Dockerfile**: Modified backend Dockerfile to:
   - Install pipenv with `pip install pipenv`
   - Copy `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock*` files
   - Use `pipenv install --system --deploy` instead of pip install

3. **Removed requirements.txt**: Deleted the old requirements.txt file

4. **Generated Pipfile.lock**: Used `pipenv install` to create the lock file for reproducible builds

## Benefits
- **Dependency Resolution**: Pipenv automatically resolves and locks dependencies
- **Virtual Environment Management**: Automatic virtual environment creation
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning capabilities
- **Separation**: Clear separation between production and development dependencies
- **Reproducible Builds**: Pipfile.lock ensures exact versions across environments
